Sub-Commands

	init     Create the "assembly.json" file.
	package  List and filter existing dependencies and packages.

Ignoring files with build tags, or excluding packages from being vendored:
	The "vendor.json" file contains a string field named "ignore".
	It may contain a space separated list of build tags to ignore when
	listing and copying files.
	This list may also contain package prefixes (containing a "/", possibly
	as last character) to exclude when copying files in the vendor folder.
	If "foo/" appears in this field, then package "foo" and all its sub-packages
	("foo/bar", â€¦) will be excluded (but package "bar/foo" will not).
	By default the init command adds the "test" tag to the ignore list.
